  "text" : "Carnal apple, Woman filled, burning moon, dark smell of seaweed, crush of mud and light, what secret knowledge is clasped between your pillars? What primal night does Man touch with his senses? Ay, Love is a journey through waters and stars, through suffocating air, sharp tempests of grain: Love is a war of lightning, and two bodies ruined by a single sweetness. Kiss by kiss I cover your tiny infinity, your margins, your rivers, your diminutive villages, and a genital fire, transformed by delight, slips through the narrow channels of blood to precipitate a nocturnal carnation, to be, and be nothing but light in the dark.  March days return with their covert light,  and huge fish swim through the sky, vague earthly vapours progress in secret, things slip to silence one by one. Through fortuity, at this crisis of errant skies, you reunite the lives of the sea to that of fire, grey lurchings of the ship of winter to the form that love carved in the guitar. O love, O rose soaked by mermaids and spume, dancing flame that climbs the invisible stairway, to waken the blood in insomnia’s labyrinth, so that the waves can complete themselves in the sky, the sea forget its cargoes and rages, and the world fall into darkness’s nets.   My dog has died. I buried him in the garden next to a rusted old machine.  Some day I'll join him right there, but now he's gone with his shaggy coat, his bad manners and his cold nose, and I, the materialist, who never believed in any promised heaven in the sky for any human being, I believe in a heaven I'll never enter. Yes, I believe in a heaven for all dogdom where my dog waits for my arrival waving his fan-like tail in friendship.  Ai, I'll not speak of sadness here on earth, of having lost a companion who was never servile. His friendship for me, like that of a porcupine withholding its authority, was the friendship of a star, aloof, with no more intimacy than was called for, with no exaggerations: he never climbed all over my clothes filling me full of his hair or his mange, he never rubbed up against my knee like other dogs obsessed with sex.  No, my dog used to gaze at me, paying me the attention I need, the attention required to make a vain person like me understand that, being a dog, he was wasting time, but, with those eyes so much purer than mine, he'd keep on gazing at me with a look that reserved for me alone all his sweet and shaggy life, always near me, never troubling me, and asking nothing.  Ai, how many times have I envied his tail as we walked together on the shores of the sea in the lonely winter of Isla Negra where the wintering birds filled the sky and my hairy dog was jumping about full of the voltage of the sea's movement: my wandering dog, sniffing away with his golden tail held high, face to face with the ocean's spray.  Joyful, joyful, joyful, as only dogs know how to be happy with only the autonomy of their shameless spirit.  There are no good-byes for my dog who has died, and we don't now and never did lie to each other.  So now he's gone and I buried him, and that's all there is to it.  The memory of you emerges from the night around me. The river mingles its stubborn lament with the sea.  Deserted like the wharves at dawn. It is the hour of departure, oh deserted one!  Cold flower heads are raining over my heart. Oh pit of debris, fierce cave of the shipwrecked.  In you the wars and the flights accumulated. From you the wings of the song birds rose.  You swallowed everything, like distance. Like the sea, like time. In you everything sank!  It was the happy hour of assault and the kiss. The hour of the spell that blazed like a lighthouse.  Pilot's dread, fury of blind driver, turbulent drunkenness of love, in you everything sank!  In the childhood of mist my soul, winged and wounded. Lost discoverer, in you everything sank!  You girdled sorrow, you clung to desire, sadness stunned you, in you everything sank!  I made the wall of shadow draw back, beyond desire and act, I walked on.  Oh flesh, my own flesh, woman whom I loved and lost, I summon you in the moist hour, I raise my song to you.  Like a jar you housed infinite tenderness. and the infinite oblivion shattered you like a jar.  There was the black solitude of the islands, and there, woman of love, your arms took me in.  There was thirst and hunger, and you were the fruit. There were grief and ruins, and you were the miracle.  Ah woman, I do not know how you could contain me in the earth of your soul, in the cross of your arms!  How terrible and brief my desire was to you! How difficult and drunken, how tensed and avid.  Cemetery of kisses, there is still fire in your tombs, still the fruited boughs burn, pecked at by birds.  Oh the bitten mouth, oh the kissed limbs, oh the hungering teeth, oh the entwined bodies.  Oh the mad coupling of hope and force in which we merged and despaired.  And the tenderness, light as water and as flour. And the word scarcely begun on the lips.  This was my destiny and in it was my voyage of my longing, and in it my longing fell, in you everything sank!  Oh pit of debris, everything fell into you, what sorrow did you not express, in what sorrow are you not drowned!  From billow to billow you still called and sang. Standing like a sailor in the prow of a vessel.  You still flowered in songs, you still brike the currents. Oh pit of debris, open and bitter well.  Pale blind diver, luckless slinger, lost discoverer, in you everything sank!  It is the hour of departure, the hard cold hour which the night fastens to all the timetables.  The rustling belt of the sea girdles the shore. Cold stars heave up, black birds migrate.  Deserted like the wharves at dawn. Only tremulous shadow twists in my hands.  Oh farther than everything. Oh farther than everything.  It is the hour of departure. Oh abandoned one!   Perhaps not to be is to be without your being, without your going, that cuts noon light like a blue flower, without your passing later through fog and stones, without the torch you lift in your hand that others may not see as golden, that perhaps no one believed blossomed the glowing origin of the rose, without, in the end, your being, your coming suddenly, inspiringly, to know my life, blaze of the rose-tree, wheat of the breeze: and it follows that I am, because you are: it follows from ‘you are’, that I am, and we: and, because of love, you will, I will, We will, come to be.   In the wave-strike over unquiet stones the brightness bursts and bears the rose and the ring of water contracts to a cluster to one drop of azure brine that falls. O magnolia radiance breaking in spume, magnetic voyager whose death flowers and returns, eternal, to being and nothingness: shattered brine, dazzling leap of the ocean. Merged, you and I, my love, seal the silence while the sea destroys its continual forms, collapses its turrets of wildness and whiteness, because in the weft of those unseen garments of headlong water, and perpetual sand, we bear the sole, relentless tenderness.   Out of lemon flowers loosed on the moonlight, love's lashed and insatiable essences, sodden with fragrance, the lemon tree's yellow emerges, the lemons move down from the tree's planetarium  Delicate merchandise! The harbors are big with it- bazaars for the light and the barbarous gold. We open the halves of a miracle, and a clotting of acids brims into the starry divisions: creation's original juices, irreducible, changeless, alive: so the freshness lives on in a lemon, in the sweet-smelling house of the rind, the proportions, arcane and acerb.  Cutting the lemon the knife leaves a little cathedral: alcoves unguessed by the eye that open acidulous glass to the light; topazes riding the droplets, altars, aromatic facades.  So, while the hand holds the cut of the lemon, half a world on a trencher, the gold of the universe wells to your touch: a cup yellow with miracles, a breast and a nipple perfuming the earth; a flashing made fruitage, the diminutive fire of a planet.   Brown and agile child, the sun which forms the fruit And ripens the grain and twists the seaweed Has made your happy body and your luminous eyes And given your mouth the smile of water.  A black and anguished sun is entangled in the twigs Of your black mane when you hold out your arms. You play in the sun as in a tidal river And it leaves two dark pools in your eyes.  Brown and agile child, nothing draws me to you, Everything pulls away from me here in the noon. You are the delirious youth of bee, The drunkedness of the wave, the power of the wheat.  My somber heart seeks you always I love your happy body, your rich, soft voice. Dusky butterfly, sweet and sure Like the wheatfiled, the sun, the poppy, and the water."
